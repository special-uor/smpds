Description: Provides functions to facilitate the access to the SPECIAL Modern 
    Pollen Data Set for Climate Reconstructions (SMPDS) and to reconstruct 
    climate variables, like Mean Temperature of the COldest month (MTCO), Mean 
    Temperature of the WArmest month (MTWA) and Growing Degree Days (GDD). Also, 
    it provides functions to find the Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) of a 
    given site.
