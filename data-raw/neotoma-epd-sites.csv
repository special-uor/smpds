A stream inflows from the southeast, and a drainage ditch bears northeast. The basin evenly shelves towards a central maximum water depth. The lake is one of a series of kettleholes associated with kame and esker topography that lies outside the Loch Lomond Stadial ice limit. Lake is surrounded by fringing reedswamp (Phragmites australis), which grades to the south/southwest to Salix-Alnus-Betula carr. Permanent pasture lies along the eastern and northern shores.
