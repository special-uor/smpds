Samples dated in Lund were pretreated with HCl, except for Lu-1789, which was pretreated with NaOH and HCl. Lu-1793 and Lu-1789 appeared too young. Samples dated in Gliwice were pretreated with HCl, the NaOH soluble fraction was not removed. Gd-802 containing too little carbon gave an approximate age only. From samples dated in Cambridge the NaOH soluble fraction was removed.
